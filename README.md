#Welcome to Jekyll

Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs!

### What is it?
Jekyll is, at its heart, a text transformation engine. It is a simple, blog-aware static site generator. You can create page templates and page elements like headers, footers, and navbars. You can create blog-type dated posts, or static pages. 



Unlike wordpress its not a CMS, but in this case your github repo will fill that role.

Jekyll supports a variety of markup languages (Markdown, HTML, Textile), and Liquid to create templates and add dynamic page elements.

Github pages has built in Jekyll support, so your repo acts as a webhost.

### Why is it good?
1. Simple (once you understand it...)
2. Secure (no database vulnerability, edit in your chosen text editor)
3. Fast (static files only)
4. Ability to publish through Github pages

### Installation:

```
gem install jekyll
```
