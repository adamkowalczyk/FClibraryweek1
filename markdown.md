# Markdown

## [Cheatsheet!](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Markdown is pretty damn simple to write, possibly harder to understand. 


>Markdown was initially created by John Gruber (of Daring Fireball) as a simple way for non-programming types to write in an easy-to-read format that could be converted directly into HTML.

> You may have heard of WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) formatting.

>Think of Markdown like a simplified WYSIWYG ... 
When web designers and developers approach a project, they build styles into the project. Those styles dictate how basic elements, like headers and links will appear.

>WYSIWYG editing tools gave away too much design control. Someone could unknowingly add a new style to the design (like red italic bold headers) without meaning to... This makes designers sad :( because their carefully crafted theme gets lost in the noise.

>Bottom line, people who edit content should focus on the words and the designer should make them pretty... When a designer pushes a new style to the website, the styles are consistently reflected across the whole site, so the design stays fresh and up to date with browser caveats and features. (Dropshadows anyone?)

>Markdown is widely accepted by developers and editors, so it's the best choice for implementing best practice. Nearly every popular content management solution supports Markdown, if not out-of-the-box, then with an easy-to-install extension. [What is Markdown?](http://whatismarkdown.com/)

Anyway, what you probably want are commands, and I will show you!
